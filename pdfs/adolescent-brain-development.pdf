# Placeholder PDF: Adolescent Brain Development Research

**Research Summary:** This document would contain research on adolescent brain development and sleep.

**Key Findings:**
- Prefrontal cortex develops until age 25
- Sleep crucial for synaptic plasticity
- Memory consolidation during REM sleep
- Neuroplasticity enhanced by adequate sleep

**Abstract:**
During adolescence, the brain undergoes significant structural and functional changes. The prefrontal cortex, responsible for decision-making and impulse control, continues developing until age 25. Sleep plays a crucial role in this process through synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation. This research examines the relationship between sleep duration, sleep quality, and cognitive development in teenagers aged 13-18.

**Methods:**
- Longitudinal study of 500 high school students
- Sleep monitoring via actigraphy
- Cognitive assessments every 6 months
- MRI imaging of brain structure changes

**Results:**
- Students with 8+ hours of sleep showed 23% better cognitive performance
- Improved memory consolidation during adequate sleep periods
- Structural brain changes correlated with sleep quality
