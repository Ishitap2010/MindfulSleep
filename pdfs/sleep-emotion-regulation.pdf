# Sleep and Emotional Regulation Research

**Research Summary:** Studies examining the impact of sleep deprivation on emotional regulation in teenagers.

**Key Findings:**
- Amygdala hyperactivity with sleep deprivation
- Reduced prefrontal cortex regulation
- Increased anxiety and depression risk
- Mood instability correlations with sleep quality

**Abstract:**
Sleep deprivation significantly impacts the teenage brain's ability to regulate emotions. The amygdala becomes hyperactive while the prefrontal cortex's regulatory influence diminishes, leading to increased anxiety, depression, and mood instability.

**Study Design:**
- fMRI studies of sleep-deprived vs. rested teens
- Emotional regulation tasks
- Mood assessments over 6 months
- Sleep pattern analysis

**Results:**
- 60% increase in amygdala reactivity when sleep deprived
- 35% reduction in prefrontal-amygdala connectivity
- Significant correlation between sleep quality and mood stability
- Anxiety scores 45% higher in chronically sleep-deprived teens

**Clinical Implications:**
- Sleep intervention as mental health treatment
- Early identification of at-risk students
- School-based sleep education programs
- Family involvement in sleep hygiene
