# Placeholder PDF: Circadian Rhythms in Teenagers

**Research Summary:** This document would contain research on circadian rhythm shifts in adolescents.

**Key Findings:**
- Natural 2-3 hour delay in circadian rhythms during adolescence
- Melatonin release occurs later in teenagers
- Impact of early school start times on sleep deprivation
- Light exposure affects circadian timing

**Abstract:**
Research by Dr. Mary Carskadon demonstrates that teenagers experience a natural 2-3 hour delay in their circadian rhythms compared to children and adults. This biological shift, combined with early school start times, creates chronic sleep deprivation in the adolescent population.

**Study Details:**
- 300 participants aged 14-18
- Melatonin level monitoring
- Sleep diary analysis over 12 months
- Academic performance correlation

**Key Results:**
- Average bedtime shift of 2.3 hours later during adolescence
- Melatonin onset delayed by 90 minutes compared to pre-teens
- Academic performance improved with later school start times
