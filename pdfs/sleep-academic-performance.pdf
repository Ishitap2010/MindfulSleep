**Meta-Analysis Results:**
- Analysis of 15 studies involving 12,000 students
- Consistent correlation between sleep and academic performance
- Effect size of r = 0.67 for sleep duration and GPA
- Memory tasks improved 40% with adequate sleep

**Study Populations:**
- Middle school students (n=4,200)
- High school students (n=6,800)  
- College freshmen (n=1,000)
